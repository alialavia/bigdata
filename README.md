Automatic News Generation Based on Twitter
=======

The authors were motivated by a simple question: can we generate more accurate and less biased news using twitter data in comparison to traditional news agencies? Would such a system have a potential of becoming an alternative to mainstream news sources? If so, such a system could be a more reliable source of unbiased news, which in turn will have immense effect on public awareness, knowledge and discourse.

Three components are included in this system:
* Data collector
* Twitter news classifier
* Visualization of news key-terms over time

### Data Collector
In order to run the `data-collectors` to collect twitter data from [Twitter Streams](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public), you should register your own twitter app key first.

All of your twitter news agent can be set under `data-collectors/news/twitter/twitternews.config`. 

### Classifier


### Visualization analysis
